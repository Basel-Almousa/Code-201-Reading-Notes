# **There are three different types of list:**
+ Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
+ Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
+ Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.
## **Ordered Lists:**
- \<ol>  
The ordered list is created with
the \<ol> element.
- \<li>  
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening \<li> tag
and a closing \</li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
## **Unordered Lists:**
- \<ul>  
The unordered list is created
with the \<ul> element.
- \<li>
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening \<li> tag
and a closing \</li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
## **Definition Lists:**
- \<dl>  
The definition list is created with
the \<dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the \<dl> element you will
usually see pairs of \<dt> and
\<dd> elements.
- \<dt>  
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
- \<dd>  
This is used to contain the
definition.
# **BOX DIMESIONS**
**_width, height_**
+ By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.
+ The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are
to use pixels, percentages, or
ems. Traditionally, pixels have
been the most popular method
because they allow designers to
accurately control their size.
## **Limiting Width**
**_min-width, max-width_**
+ Some page designs expand and
shrink to fit the size of the user's
screen. In such designs, the
min-width property specifies
the smallest size a box can be
displayed at when the browser
window is narrow, and the
max-width property indicates
the maximum width a box can
stretch to when the browser
window is wide.
+ These are very helpful properties
to ensure that the content of
pages are legible (especially on
the smaller screens of handheld
devices). For example, you can
use the max-width property to
ensure that lines of text do not
appear too wide within a big
browser window and you can
use the min-width property
to make sure that they do not
appear too narrow.
## **Limiting Height**
**_min-height, max-height_**
+ In the same way that you might
want to limit the width of a box
on a page, you may also want
to limit the height of it. This is
achieved using the min-height
and max-height properties.
## **CREATING AN ARRAY**
+ You create an array and give it 
a name just like you would any 
other variable (using the var 
keyword followed by the name of 
the array). 
+ The values are assigned to the 
array inside a pair of square 
brackets, and each value is 
separated by a comma. The 
values in the array do not need 
to be the same data type, so you 
can store a string, a number and 
a Boolean all in the same array.
## **VALU ES IN ARRAYS**
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in 
a numbered list. It is important to know that the 
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
## **loop-switch** 
+ It is a programming antipattern where a clear set of steps is implemented as a switch-within-a-loop. The loop-switch sequence is a specific derivative of spaghetti code.
+ It is not necessarily an antipattern to use a switch statement within a loopâ€”it is only considered incorrect when used to model a known sequence of steps. The most common example of the correct use of a switch within a loop is an inversion of control such as an event handler. In event handler loops, the sequence of events is not known at compile-time, so the repeated switch is both necessary and correct
