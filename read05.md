# Why do we add pictures to websites:
> + Images can be used to set the
tone for a site in less time than
it takes to read a description. If
you do not have photographs
to use on your website, there
are companies who sell stock
images; these are images you
pay to use (there is a list of stock
photography websites below).
Remember that all images are
subject to copyright, and you
can get in trouble for simply
taking photographs from
another website.
If you have a page that shows
several images (such as product
photographs or members of a
team) then putting them on a
simple, consistent background
helps them look better as
a group.
# How to Add Images into page!!
\<img>
To add an image into the page
you need to use an <img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
src
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site. (Here you can see that
the images are in a child folder
called images â€” relative URLs
were covered on pages 83-84).
alt
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.
title
You can also use the title
attribute with the <img> element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.
Adding Images
The text used in the alt attribute
is often referred to as alt text.
It should give an accurate
description of the image content
so it can be understood by
screen reader software (used by
people with visual impairments)
and search engines.
If the image is just to make a
page look more attractive (and
it has no meaning, such as a
graphic dividing line), then the
alt attribute should still be used
but the quotes should be left
empty
# Height & Width of Images: 
+ height  
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.
+ width  
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.
# Where to Place Images in Your Code:
+ **1: before a paragraph**  
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.
+ **2: inside the start of a
paragraph**  
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.
+ **3: in the middle of a
paragraph**  
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in
# Aligning Images Horizontally and Vertically
+ **top**  
This aligns the first line of the
surrounding text with the top of
the image.
+ **middle**  
This aligns the first line of the
surrounding text with the middle
of the image.
+ **bottom**  
This aligns the first line of the
surrounding text with the bottom
of the image.
+ **left**  
This aligns the image to the left
(allowing text to flow around its
right-hand side).
+ **right**  
This aligns the image to the right
(allowing text to flow around its
left-hand side).
# There are Three Rules for Creating Images
+ Save images in
the right format
Websites mainly use images in
jpeg, gif, or png format. If you
choose the wrong image
format then your image might
not look as sharp as it should
and can make the web page
slower to load.
+ Save images at
the right size
You should save the image at
the same width and height it will
appear on the website. If
the image is smaller than the
width or height that you have
specified, the image can be
distorted and stretched. If the
image is larger than the width
and height if you have specified,
the image will take longer to
display on the page
+ Use the correct
resolution
Computer screens are made up
of dots known as pixels. Images
used on the web are also made
up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
to the number of dots per inch,
and most computer screens only
show web pages at 72 pixels
per inch. So saving images at
a higher resolution results in
images that are larger than
necessary and take longer to
download.
# **Adding Background Color to the page:**
_background-color_  
+ CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.
You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names
