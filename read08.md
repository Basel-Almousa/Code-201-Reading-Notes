# **HTML elements**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box :  
+ Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:  
\<h1> \<p> \<ul> \<li>.
+ Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:
\<img> \<b> \<i>.
# **How to Control the Position of Elements**
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page:  
+ **Normal flow**  
Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.
Even if you specify the width
of the boxes and there is space
for two elements to sit side-byside, they will not appear next
to each other. This is the default
behavior (unless you tell the
browser to do something else).
+ **Relative Positioning**  
This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed. This
does not affect the position of
surrounding elements; they stay
in the position they would be in
in normal flow.
+ **Absolute positioning**  
This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element. It is taken out of
normal flow, meaning that it
does not affect the position
of any surrounding elements
(as they simply ignore the
space it would have taken up).
Absolutely positioned elements
move as users scroll up and
down the page
+ **Fixed Positioning**  
This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions
the element in relation to the
browser window, as opposed
to the containing element.
Elements with fixed positioning
do not affect the position of
surrounding elements and they
do not move when the user
scrolls up or down the page.
+ **Floating Elements**  
Floating an element allows
you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box. The floated
element becomes a block-level
element around which other
content can flow.
# _**functions, methods, and objects**_
+ **Functions**  
Functions are like recipes. They can execute a set of instructions on data or variables and return the result. The beauty of functions is that they are recyclable. That is, the function can be used repeatedly without having to write the same code again.
+ **Methods**  
A method, like a function, is a set of instructions that perform a task. The difference is that a method is associated with an object, while a function is not. Let’s explore some of JavaScript’s built-in methods.
+ **Objects**
JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. ... In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.
# **Reasons for Pair Programming**

# How to Create Multi-Column Layouts with Floats
The following three CSS
properties are used to position
the columns next to each other:  
- **width**  
This sets the width of the
columns.
- **float**  
This positions the columns next
to each other.
- **margin**  
This creates a gap between the
columns.
