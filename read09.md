# Why do we use Forms?
+ The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage.
+ In addition to enabling users to
search, forms also allow users
to perform other functions
online. You will see forms
+ when registering as a member
of a website, when shopping
online, and when signing up for
newsletters or mailing lists.
# How Forms Work
+ A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.
+ The name of each form
control is sent to the
server along with the
value the user enters or
selects.
+ The server processes
the information using a
programming language
such as PHP, C#, VB .net,
or Java. It may also store
the information in a
database.
+ The server creates a new
page to send back to the
browser based on the
information received.
# Form Structure
+ **\<form>**  
Form controls live inside a
\<form> element. This element
should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a
method and id attribute too.
+ action  
Every \<form> element requires
an action attribute. Its value
is the URL for the page on the
server that will receive the
information in the form when it
is submitted.
+ method  
Forms can be sent using one of
two methods: get or post.
+ id  
We look at the id attribute on
page 183, but the value is used to
identify the form distinctly from
other elements on the page (and
is often used by scripts â€” such
as those that check you have
entered information into fields
that require values).
# list-style-type
+ The list-style-type property
allows you to control the shape
or style of a bullet point (also
known as a marker).
It can be used on rules that
apply to the \<ol>, \<ul>, and \<li>
elements.
# list-style-image
+ You can specify an image to act
as a bullet point using the
list-style-image property.
+ The value starts with the letters
url and is followed by a pair
of parentheses. Inside the
parentheses, the path to the
image is given inside double
quotes.
+ This property can be used on
rules that apply to the \<ul> and
\<li> elements.
# list-style-position
the marker should
appear on the inside or the
outside of the box containing the
main points.
This property can take one of
two values:
+ outside  
The marker sits to the left of the
block of text. (This is the default
behaviour if this property is not
used.)
+ inside  
The marker sits inside the box of
text (which is indented).
# JavaScript Events
+ HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
+ When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

# HTML Events
+ An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

+ Here are some examples of HTML events:

1-  An HTML web page has finished loading

2-   An HTML input field was changed

3-  An HTML button was clicked
+ Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

+ JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

+ HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
# What can JavaScript Do?
Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions: such as:
+ Things that should be done every time a page loads
+ Things that should be done when the page is closed
+ Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
+ Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
