# HTML Images Syntax
+ The HTML \<img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
+ The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

+ The \<img> tag has two required attributes:  

1- src - Specifies the path to the image  
2- alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
Syntax

## The src Attribute
The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

- **Note:** When a web page loads; it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.
## The alt Attribute
+ The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
+ The value of the alt attribute should describe the image
## Image Size - Width and Height
+ You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.
+ The width and height attributes always define the width and height of the image in pixels.

# HTML Background Images
+ A background image can be specified for almost any HTML element.

+ To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property

# Background Repeat
+ If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element
+ To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to **no-repeat**.

## On-Page SEO
+  **Page Title**  
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the \<title> element which lives
inside the \<head> element
+  **URL / Web Address**  
The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.
+  **Headings**  
If the keywords are in a heading
\<hn> element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.
+  **Text**  
Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.
+ **Link Text**  
Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here").
+  **Image Alt Text**  
Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.
+  **Page Descriptions**  
The description also lives inside
the \<head> element and is
specified using a \<meta> tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page. (These are not shown in
the browser window but they
may be displayed in the result
