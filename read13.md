# There are three potential dealbreaking downsides for Cookies :
+ Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
+ Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
+ Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful
# HTML5 STORAGE
+ HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats.
+ However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.
# LIMITATIONS IN CURRENT BROWSERS
“5 megabytes” is how much storage space each origin gets by default. This is surprisingly consistent across browsers, although it is phrased as no more than a suggestion in the HTML5 Storage specification. One thing to keep in mind is that you’re storing strings, not data in its original format. If you’re storing a lot of integers or floats, the difference in representation can really add up. Each digit in that float is being stored as a character, not in the usual representation of a floating point number.
