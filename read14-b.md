## There were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:
+ Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
+ Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.
+ Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
+ Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
+ Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.
## Why pragmatism is a rarely desired trait?
+ Employees in the medical field might not need a strong degree of creativity (a.k.a. those right brained personalities). But across the board in every business and industry, when teams come together, EQ (emotional intelligence) matters much more than IQ (intelligence quotient).

+ EQ, which reflects and strengthens a person’s right-brain skills, enhances self-awareness and increases humility. It is far more beneficial for the team — regardless of their skill set.
## Left brained vs. right brained personalities
+ **Right brained people**     are said to be more intuitive, creative, free-thinking and have the ability to collaborate and connect. They are the relationship-builders, and they are vital to a team’s success.
+ **Left brained people**   by contrast, are more logical, analytical and objective. Unlike right brained people, who tend to think in visuals, left brains are detail- and fact-oriented, and they prefer to think in words and numbers. They are more pragmatic. While left brain skills and traits may distinguish individual contributors, they are only table stakes (literally, as they can mostly earn you a seat at a team’s table).
